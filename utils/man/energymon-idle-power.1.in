.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
Intended to measure the idle power of the system by doing nothing.
In fact, it just measures the average power during the \fISECONDS\fP
specified (10 by default), regardless of whether the system is actually idle.
Uses the @MAN_IMPL@ EnergyMon implementation.
.LP
The \fISECONDS\fP value must be a positive integer.
Note that if \fISECONDS\fP is too short for the EnergyMon implementation to get
updated energy readings, the average power will be reported as 0.
